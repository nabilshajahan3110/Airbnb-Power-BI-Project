Power BI dashboard and report for Airbnb NY 2019
NEW YORK AIRBNB LISTINGS PROJECT
CREATED BY: NABIL MOHAMMED SHAJAHAN
In this report, I have reviewed the Airbnb dataset for New York City in the year 2019. This dataset covers three types of properties with varying days of availabilities across the five neighbourhoods. Additionally, it also covers availability frequency, exact location, price, and reviews received. I have analysed various trends across five neighbourhoods to understand how pricing, room types, listings, and location affect various trends. My primary bases for this report were neighbourhood and room type, since these are the key metrics used by majority of the patrons.
OVERVIEW
One measure created: Count Host ID

FINDINGS
The total number of listings across New York clearly depicts the popularity enjoyed by the city in terms of attracting tourists and visitors. Out of all the neighbourhoods, Brooklyn and Manhattan claims major shares due to its proximity to crucial travel ports, popular tourist destinations, and engaging events that occur all year round.
A vast majority of listings were claimed by Entire Apartments/Private Dwellings and Private Rooms. Shared rooms are rarely listed throughout the city.
Staten Island maintains the lowest number of listings across all property types.
The price ranges of all the neighbourhoods falls close to each other, with Manhattan claiming the top spot marginally. Among property types, Entire Apartment/Private Dwellings is the most expensive choice due to size, amenities, and comfort offered.
Due to higher occupancy rates, Entire Apartments/Private Dwellings received most of the reviews.
Posted reviews' pattern suggests a gradual rise from February to May, with a steep climb during June and July. Then the trend drops in August and remains the same level till the end of the year.
